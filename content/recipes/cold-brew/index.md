Cold Brew Coffee is brewed cold in the fridge, due to it's brewing process it's less bitter and thus more sweet then coffee brewed hot. In the summer we make cold brew by the gallon, letting it steep for 24-32 hours in a glass jar, straining out the grinds, and just leave it in the fridge for the week. Of course you can make it at a smaller scale we just happen to have a 1 gallon glass jar because I used to make kombucha.

## Ingredients

2 1/2 cups of coffee coarsely ground

## Recipe

1. Add the coffee grinds to a 1 gallon vessel
2. Fill the vessel with water and stir.
3. Cover the top, put in the fridge and wait 24-32 hours
4. Strain coffee grinds out of cold brew... Thats it.

I drink it black most of the time, but you can add milk and various simple syrups. Sometimes I put a small amount of maple syrup in it. It's quite nice.
