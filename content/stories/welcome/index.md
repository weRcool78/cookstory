Welcome to CookStory.Life, a website by William and Emily COOK. Our intention for this website is for it to be a place where we can post about our LIFE and STORY as we continue our journey as a married couple following Jesus. We want to share our findings and experiences to help bless others as well as live in a community.
There will be four main sections to the site to start off.
1. Library, this is where we will post about books, movies, and other things we own and recommend along with guides to why we selected said media. 
2. Tech, this is where William will post about technology, software, and projects he is working on.
3. Reflections, this is where Emily will post blogs as a creative writer and journal keeper.
4. Recipes, this will be where William and Emily post their favourite recipes as Cooks and tips about making meals on a budget.
   
All in all, this is a space for us to have fun and express ourselves in a digital and public way.
